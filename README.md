## 👥 Team Roles
Each member of the team plays a vital role in project success:

- **Backend Developer**: Builds and maintains backend logic, APIs, and services.  
- **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Designs, optimizes, and maintains the relational database.  
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages CI/CD pipelines, Docker setup, and deployment automation.  
- **Security Specialist**: Ensures APIs and data are secured with authentication, authorization, and encryption.  
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates tasks, ensures deadlines are met, and manages collaboration.  

---

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
This project leverages modern tools and frameworks:

- **Django** → Backend framework for RESTful APIs.  
- **MySQL** → Relational database system for storing users, properties, and bookings.  
- **GraphQL** → API query language for flexible client-server communication.  
- **Docker** → Containerization tool to ensure environment consistency.  
- **GitHub Actions** → CI/CD pipeline automation for testing and deployment.  

---

## 🗄️ Database Design
The database will include the following key entities:

- **Users**  
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`.  
  - A user can list multiple properties and make multiple bookings.  

- **Properties**  
  - Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`.  
  - A property belongs to a user (host).  

- **Bookings**  
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`.  
  - A booking is linked to both a user (guest) and a property.  

- **Reviews**  
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`.  
  - A review is written by a user for a property.  

- **Payments**  
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`.  
  - Each booking generates a payment.  

---

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown
Core features of the Airbnb Clone:

- **User Management** → Register, log in, update profiles, and manage authentication.  
- **Property Management** → Hosts can add, update, and delete property listings.  
- **Booking System** → Guests can browse properties and book available dates.  
- **Reviews & Ratings** → Users can leave feedback on properties they’ve stayed at.  
- **Payment Integration** → Secure payment system for processing bookings.  

---

## 🔐 API Security
Security is crucial for user trust and data protection:

- **Authentication** → Ensures only valid users can access protected routes (JWT or OAuth2).  
- **Authorization** → Restricts actions (e.g., only hosts can manage properties).  
- **Rate Limiting** → Prevents API abuse and denial-of-service attacks.  
- **Encryption** → Sensitive data (passwords, payments) stored securely.  
- **Validation** → Prevents malicious input and SQL injection.  

---

## ⚡ CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD ensures smooth and automated development workflows:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** → Runs automated tests on every push or pull request.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** → Deploys code automatically after successful tests.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - **GitHub Actions** → Automates build, test, and deploy workflows.  
  - **Docker** → Ensures consistent environments across dev, test, and production.

# AirBnB Clone Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **AirBnB Clone Project** is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core features of the Airbnb platform. The main goal is to provide a smooth booking experience where users can browse property listings, view details, and complete simple checkouts.  

### 🎯 Project Goals  
- Build a user-friendly property booking system.  
- Implement both frontend (UI/UX) and backend (APIs, database) functionalities.  
- Practice team collaboration with defined roles and responsibilities.  
- Deploy the project to a live server for real-world usability.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Figma (UI/UX design)  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JWT, bcrypt  
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Netlify (frontend), Render / Heroku (backend)  
- **Version Control:** GitHub
